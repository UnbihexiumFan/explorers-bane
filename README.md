Explorer's Bane is a 3D voxel game developed by me, UnbihexiumFan. Not to be confused with _The Explorer's Bane_.

Nobody ever said it had good graphics.

To access the game, go to explorers_bane/main.py.

See the [_wiki_](https://github.com/UnbihexiumFan/explorers-bane/wiki) for more information.

It has many different gameplay styles.
