## December 29th

Explorer's Bane Alpha is out! After 89 days the alpha version of Explorer's Bane has been officially published! Explorer's Bane has come a long way since it was made on October 1st.

Back then, in v0.0.0 you could just fly around and whatnot, and there was a single tree in the middle of nowhere.

v0.0.1 made minor changes, though it happened one step at a time. This is because UnbihexiumFan may or may not have tested his code first... hehe.

v0.1.0, the Survival Update, introduced many new items into the game, and there was more trees. It also added sheep and spiders. Mutton, from sheep, was the only way to heal yourself. If you ever go deep underground looking for stone, you may be greeted by a swarm of spiders ready to attack! The Survival Update also made it harder, and, as playing things easy make them boring, made the game more exciting!

v0.2.0, the Sandbox Update, added new features such as sand, but mainly added 2 new ways to play the game, Sandbox and Spectate. In many ways Sandbox mode was like v0.0.0.

v0.2.0_1 fixed a few bugs.

v0.2.0_1-399 is a version made to be supported by Python 3.9.9.

Finally, _Explorer's Bane Alpha_ is a 2-in-one file of v0.2.0_1 and v0.2.0_1-399.
